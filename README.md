This is a demo for using the Exosite CoAP API.

Full documentation for the CoAP API can be found at 
https://github.com/exosite/docs/tree/master/coap

Note: The CoAP API is in beta. It will change before it is released, this
example may be out of date.

# Known Issues
The API is currently broken, the path must be sent as a single path option with
slashes delimiting the path items. eg. ("/1a/temp",) not ("1a", "temp").
